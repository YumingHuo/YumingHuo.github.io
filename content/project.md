## Front-end and back-end for automated stacking robots

*2022.10-2023.05 JavaScript Python*

* Responsible for the front-end development and some of the back-end Python development content of the project, using tools such as Panda3D and Three.js to simulate the reality of the state of the bots as well as the content of the stack to the web side. Used tailwind CSS to beautify the web end and implemented dark mode.
* Use the A* algorithm to calculate the shortest route and optimal solution for the movement of the boxes, optimize the algorithm parameters and heuristic functions, and test and evaluate them.
* Bind the project to the domain name and server, and use DNS configuration and FTP upload to realize the online and access of the website.

-----------------
## Closed 2D matrix-based “Game of Life” gamesdassad

*2022.10-2023.01 Golong*

* Use Golang to complete the main logic of this cellular machine to reach the final goal.
* In the parallel part, use SDL to realize the real-time progress of the project, and effectively solve the problems of deadlock and competition in the project.
* Use thread and lock technology to realize parallel processing, and perform performance testing and optimization.
* Use AWS Node for distributed development, and use Halo Exchange to ensure efficient communication between nodes.

-----------------
## Global press release management system

*2023.02-now  React*

> GitHub: https://github.com/YumingHuo/system

* Building projects with react, routing with router, etc.
* Completed: Login module (login verification blocking, particle effects), Permission management module (permission list, role list), User management module.
* Scheduled to be completed: News management module (drafts, etc.), Review module, Posting management module (pending, posted, etc.).

## CNN-based plant pest identification

*2023.07-2023.08 Python YoloV5*

> GitHub: https://github.com/YumingHuo/plant-pests

* A crawler tool was written in Python to collect images of more than twenty types of maize diseases from the Internet and to ensure the quality and quantity of the data.
* Use data enhancement techniques to increase the diversity and quantity of the data set, such as rotation, flipping, scaling, and cropping. Use image processing libraries such as OpenCV and Pillow to implement data enhancement.
* Use the yolov5 model to implement the identification of corn pests and diseases, and use the COCO pre-training weight and SGD optimizer, and train and optimize the model.
* Use data parallelism and mixed precision technology to accelerate training, and optimize hyperparameters such as batch size and learning rate.
* Use the mAP metric to evaluate the performance of the model. This model achieves an mAP score of 85%.

-----------------
## Data visualisation analysis platform

*2023.07-2023.08 JavaScript Echarts Vue Springboot*

* Use JavaScript, Echarts, Vue, Springboot and other technologies and tools to realize the front-end UI design, back-end data processing, interactive logic, etc. of the data visualization platform.
* Calculate the maximum value, minimum value, average value, median, sum, variance and standard deviation of the data set, and perform variance analysis, regression analysis, correlation analysis and cluster analysis.
* Use algorithms and models such as ANOVA, linear regression, multiple regression, Pearson correlation coefficient, and K-Means clustering to discover the rules and relationships in the data set.
* Use tools such as Echarts, Vue, JavaScript, etc. to display the analysis results in a visual form on the web. Increase user interactivity and operability, such as adding filtering, sorting, searching and other functions.

-----------------
## Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Computer Vision Direction)

*2023.07-2023.08 Python CNN CV2*

* Implemented lane line detection in images and videos for unmanned driving using cv2 and Python with lane line highlighting and real-time previews, and can proficiently apply Canny edge detection and Hough transforms, etc.
* Handwriting recognition on MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Convolutional Neural Networks.
